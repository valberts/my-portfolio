My first project is a portfolio website. Not so difficult, but it's something that I’ve been wanting to make for a while and will serve as the as a good starting point/central hub for all my work. I’ve tried to make a portfolio website a few times already, but I was never happy with the result and I could never find a tech stack that clicked for me.

### Tech Stack

For this project, and probably any web project I will undertake in the future, I’m using Next.js. I really like Next.js and it’s the first framework that has really clicked for me. Alongside Next.js, I’m using Tailwind CSS which is also just so great that I don’t even know how to express it. Tailwind CSS just makes it so much easier to handle styling and the developer experience is smooth. I don’t need to be constantly switching between the files and worrying about what classname I’m using for elements, and it has also given me a good understanding of how CSS and the DOM works through experimentation with it.

For the blog and project posts, I am using markdown files that are saved with the project files and that sort of serves as the backend. I’m not using a proper backend since it’s pretty much just a static site where only the blog posts and their content could change every few days or whenever I post. I do plan on making a proper fullstack project in the future though.

I’m using Mailchimp to power the email signups and newsletters. I’m not sure what I want to do with that yet, but I think it could be useful to collect emails and keep those people updated when I post new content. I mean, I’m just using this site as my portfolio/blog and don’t expect much traffic, but I thought it was a cool feature to have anyway.

### Conclusion

So yeah, there isn’t much to say about this project. It was pretty small and simple, but I’m quite happy with the outcome. I have lots of projects I still want to do and I'm trying to make more time to work on that. I have been quite interested in graphics programming recently. It’s been fun though, finishing a project feels good. Now I just need to write some more blog posts, buy a domain name, and figure out what I want to work on next.
